How To Install And Configure Sendmail On Ubuntu
https://gist.github.com/adamstac/7462202

https://www.abeautifulsite.net/configuring-sendmail-on-ubuntu-1404

1. Install Sendmail
$ sudo apt-get install sendmail
2. Configure /etc/hosts file:
Find your hostname by typing:

$ hostname
Then:

$ sudo nano /etc/hosts
On the line starting with 127.0.0.1, add the hostname to the end so it looks the same as:

127.0.0.1 localhost hostname
(You willl notice that your hostname can also be identified on the line that starts with 127.0.1.1 where it appears twice)

Ctrl+x, then ‘Y' to save and exit.

3. Run Sendmail's config and answer ‘Y' to everything:
$ sudo sendmailconfig
4. Restart Apache
$ sudo service apache2 restart
5. Using sendmail:
To quickly send an email:

$ sendmail -v someone@email.com
After hitting the enter key, on the line directly below, enter a From address (each line after you hit enter will be blank):

From: you@yourdomain.com
Hit enter again and type a subject:

Subject: This is the subject field of the email
Hit enter again and type the message:

This is the message to be sent.
Hit enter again. To send the email, type a ‘.‘ (period/dot) on the empty line and press enter:

.
Wait a few seconds and you will see the output of the email being sent. To see more usage examples, check out the links below.

ERRORS & SOLUTIONS
If you can not send mail.

When sending emails from your server, make sure to check any spam folders for receipt. If email is for some reason not working, try the steps below (modify the php version below as necessary):

$ sudo nano /etc/php/7.0/fpm/php.ini
Ctrl+w to search for and find ‘sendmail_path'. Uncomment this line and add the path below:

sendmail_path= /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i
Restart php:

$ sudo service php7.0-fpm restart

I don’t get this one bit, what does local host have anything to do with send mail.

I can send mail via echo “My test email being sent from sendmail” | /usr/sbin/sendmail myemail@domain.com but how do I configure sendmail to always use myemail@domain.coml

Hello, localhost is your server which sendmail uses to send the email. The post has been updated to reflect a basic usage example that includes a ‘From’ field. To configure sendmail to always use a specific email address, check out this link at https://clients.javapipe.com/knowledgebase/132/How-to-Test-Sendmail-From-Command-Line-on-Linux.html where you would create a template file, for example:

$ cd ~
$ sudo nano mail.txt
with some content like:

To: someone@email.com
Subject: sendmail test
From: me@mydomain.com

And here goes the e-mail body, test test test..
and send email with:

$ sendmail -vt < ~/mail.txt

Hi all – I’ve always had trouble with sendmail – but I thought I would try again with a new server
When you config it you are supposed to say ‘Y’ to everything – there no option to to add/change parameters.
Hence I get ‘connection timed out’ message – In NZ port 25 is not allowed .
Question – were is the parameters file to change sendmail configuration.
Much appreciated.

Ken Favors says:

You can see the location of the config file on the 2nd ‘Y’ option.
The config file is located at

/etc/mail/sendmail.mc
If you would like to change the port number, see

Thanks, it worked for me. I have question, i need to configure to use Sendmail only as Sending SMTP server. I have apps hosted in EC2 instance and from those apps i want send emails to specific email-groups basaed on events, for example JIRA or from Confluence. How can i do that ?, do you have any other article which can help me in this ?

Do you know what the problem might be when an additional name is added to the sender?

liwa@BRITNEYSPEARS:~$ sendmail -v

>>> MAIL From: SIZE=49 AUTH=liwa@myhostname.domain.se.domain.se
250 2.1.0 … Sender ok

It just adds a FQDN, and then the domain on top of that. Might it be a corrupt SPF1 record or something?

Not sure if this could be the answer, but did you try to send using the format below?

$ sendmail -v someone@email.com

How does sendmail know with which credentials it has to log in into let´s says an gmail account? sending mail via sendmail from command line works, but i don´t understand why. Why can i login into the account without me having told it what the credentials are?
